# MkDocs Documentation Generation Rules

## General Structure
- All documentation should be written in Markdown format
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 -> H2 -> H3)
- Main page should be named `index.md`
- File names should be lowercase with hyphens for spaces (e.g., `getting-started.md`)
- Include a table of contents where appropriate using the `[TOC]` marker

## Content Guidelines
- Start each page with a clear H1 title
- Include a brief introduction after the title
- Use code blocks with appropriate language syntax highlighting
- Document code examples thoroughly with comments
- Use admonitions for notes, warnings, and tips (e.g., `!!! note`, `!!! warning`)
- Include screenshots or diagrams where they add value
- Link to related documentation pages using relative links
- Keep language clear, concise, and accessible

## Navigation Structure
- Organize documentation in logical sections
- Create a clear hierarchy from general to specific topics
- Include a navigation sidebar with meaningful section names
- Ensure all pages are accessible from the navigation

## Configuration
- Initially create `mkdocs.yml` if doesn't exist
- Update `mkdocs.yml` when adding new pages
- Configure appropriate plugins and extensions
- Use consistent theme settings throughout documentation
- Set proper metadata for SEO optimization

## API Documentation
- Document each function/method with:
  - Purpose
  - Parameters (with types)
  - Return values
  - Examples
  - Exceptions/errors
- Group related API functions together
- Include version information where appropriate

## Best Practices
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Review documentation for accuracy regularly
- Test all code examples to ensure they work
- Optimize for readability on both desktop and mobile
- Consider internationalization needs if applicable
